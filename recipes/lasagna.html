    <h1>Classic Italian Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../img/two.png">
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This simple lasagna is perfect for when you're short on time, but craving a comforting meal. 
        Ready in just over an hour, it requires only 50 minutes of cooking in the oven.
        Extra-lean ground beef (which sometimes cooks up dry) works well here because it's combined with marinara to keep it moist.
        For a quick and easy variation, feel free to use 9 whole lasagna noodles instead of 6 broken noodles, using 3 noodles per layer. 
        You also can sub fresh basil leaves for the parsley sprinkled on at the end.
